# Astrum-DEVSOC'21
  
### ABSTRACT:
Time has helplessly watched women suffer in the form of discrimination, oppression, exploitation, degradation, aggression, humiliation. Welcome to the 21st century where the reality is not too different; women are attacked and assaulted, and no more feel safe to freely roam around the city at regular hours too.

There have been unavoidable situations wherein they have to travel late at night through isolated streets for work. The mobile apps to send emergency alarms and pepper sprays for self-defense are but to no avail since the fundamental issue still haunts her right there - The need for a well-devised ESCAPE PLAN in the golden hour before she gets the much-needed help.


### NOVELTY:
Our aim is to strike at the very root, and capacitate women with a full-proof escape plan to a much safer place and buy them time until the help reaches them. This is over and above the current devices which are only capable of sending SOS messages.

We also plan to make use of self-defense mechanisms like taser as additional security which immobilizes the attacker for some time and enables them to escape.

### TECH-STACK:
Software: Android Studio, Kotlin, Firebase, Google Maps SDK

Hardware: Fiberglass baton, Boost converter 3.6-6V to 400kV

### IMPLEMENTATION:
We plan to develop an IoT device along with an Android app that can make women's movement safer. Women can get swift and supreme safety support by voice-enabled commands to the Android app which will then fetch in real-time the nearest crowded location be it, police stations, marketplaces, etc. The well-devised escape plan would give her prompt instructions to a safer place through Google Maps SDK.

The IoT device will capacitate her with self-defense mechanisms - a taser that requires a small battery input of around 4-6 V, to produce voltage levels of up to 400,000 V. Adequate insulation is provided to ensure the user's well-being, while thoroughly immobilizing the attacker for some time.

We plan to make an expandable baton that has a taser at its tip. It is small and light to carry. It can be hooked to one's belt, handbag, etc. it can be used in case of emergency without the need of unhooking it.

### IMPACT - User adoption metrics:
Through this comprehensive Escape plan device with inbuilt self-defense techniques, we expect to make the women in distress self-sufficient to tackle the issue head-on and not wait for aid helplessly. We believe such devices when adopted by the users would give them a sense of safety and would greatly contribute to getting her out of abusive circumstances
